# sphinx-playground
A standard Sphinx setup with Markdown to evaluate for Alemira

## TODO

* [x] Boostrap a Sphinx project
* [x] Enable Markdown authoring
* [ ] Understand and document how to use Sphinx directives
* [ ] Provide required packages as requirements.txt (Ekaterina shouldn't need to run each pip command separately):
  ```
  pip install sphinx
  pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
  pip install myst-parser
  ```
* [ ] Provide syntax samples and links to syntax references and tutorials
